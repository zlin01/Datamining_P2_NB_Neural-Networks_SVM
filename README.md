You can run the code just for final reslut by using python naive_bayes.py <training_path> <test_path>

The following steps are how I get my data:

To download the data 20_newsgroups.tar.gz go: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/113/twenty+newsgroups

Use 60% of the data as the training data and 40% of thedata as the test data.
Name of Training dataset folder:
20_newsgroups_Train
Name of Test dataset folder:
20_newsgroups_Test

Create bag of words,
Compile all the removed words in a single text document called â€œeliminate.txt
